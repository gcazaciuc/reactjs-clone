# Reactjs clone

I've set out to build a mostly compatible ReactJS clone, all while
documenting the process step by step with a blog post.

I'm looking into creating also a set of videos for each part but
I don't promise anything.

## Get up and running

You can follow along by cloning this repository.

Move the the folder where you've cloned the project and install the dependencies:

```console
cd <my-project>

npm i
```

compile the code and run the local web server:

```console
npm run start
```

Open up the URL displayed in the console and play around with the code.
